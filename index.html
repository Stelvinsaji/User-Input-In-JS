        // keydown value is mostly good for games. eg. If u wanna move ur character to the left or right
        console.log(e);
        // Inside keydown u will have an event obj. If u console.log the event obj & press the arrow keys, the console will print the keyboard event obj.
        // Inside the keyboard event obj there will be a code telling u which button was pressed. eg. code: 'ArrowLeft'
        // U can also detect the key by console.log(e.code).

        // This is rarely used
